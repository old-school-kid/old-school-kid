### :vulcan_salute: _Hi, friend! Pleased to meet you._ 
<div align="left">I am still learning what to learn. I am extremely fascinated towards Data Science and especially Computer Vision and its application in robotics. I also love participating in Hackathons, reading literature related to visual tasks
